Life Cycle or the steps in any Data Science Project:
1.  Understanding The Problem 
2.  Gathering Relevant Data
3.  Data Preparation & EDA (Data Analysis)
4.  Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction
5.   Model Building & Deployment

*******************************************************

1) Problem Understanding
->Clearly define the project goals.
->Establish success metrics.
->Identify the type of problem (classification, regression, etc.).

2) Data Collection
->Acquire data from various sources.
->Ensure data relevance to the problem.
->Assess data quality and quantity.

3) Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis
->Cleanse data by handling missing values and duplicates.
->Conduct exploratory analysis for insights.
->Standardize or scale data as needed.

4) Feature Engineering & Selection
->Develop new features to enhance model predictions.
->Perform dimensionality reduction for large feature sets.
->Choose key features for model training.

5) Model Development & Deployment
->Select suitable algorithms and train models.
->Evaluate model accuracy with cross-validation.
->Implement the model for real-time or batch use.
